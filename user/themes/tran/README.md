If you want to set X-Corporation as the default theme, you can do so by following these steps:

## Updating

### GPM Update (Preferred)

The simplest way to update this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm). You can do this with this by navigating to the root directory of your Grav install using your system's Terminal (also called command line) and typing the following:

    bin/gpm update x-corporation

This command will check your Grav install to see if your Gateway theme is due for an update. If a newer release is found, you will be asked whether or not you wish to update. To continue, type `y` and hit enter. The theme will automatically update and clear Grav's cache.

### Manual Update

Manually updating X-Corporation is pretty simple. Here is what you will need to do to get this done:

* Delete the `your/site/user/themes/x-corporation` directory.
* Download the new version of the X-Corporation theme from this repository.
* Unzip the zip file in `your/site/user/themes` and rename the resulting folder to `x-corporation`.
* Clear the Grav cache. The simplest way to do this is by going to the root Grav directory in terminal and typing `bin/grav clear-cache`.

> Note: Any changes you have made to any of the files listed under this directory will also be removed and replaced by the new set. Any files located elsewhere (for example a YAML settings file placed in `user/config/themes`) will remain intact.
